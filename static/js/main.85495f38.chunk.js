Artwork found in Walsall Wood\n<p>Free things to do in Walsall with the family or for days out</p>\n<p>Mr Bourne told Black Country Live : "I was taken aback but how much detail had gone into it. I knew of Banksy\'s work so I Googled it and compared it and it looked liked one of his pieces.</p>\n<p>"It\'s quite a secluded spot, I found it around 10am in the morning."</p>\n<p>In his spare time, James likes to take photos of old buildings in his area before they are knocked down - that\'s how he stumbled across this.</p>\n<p>He added: "The first time I spotted it i didn\'t have my camera with me so came back a few days later and two words in graffiti had been added either side."</p>\n<p>Last year, Walsall Council\'s planning committee gave the thumbs up for plans to convert Sunnyside Farm (near Coppice Lane) into 62 new homes.</p>\n<p>The land had been deemed an eyesore by local business owners anc councillors who welcomed the plans.</p>\n<p>The photographer from Walsall said: "It\'s a shame that it\'s going to disappear. It\'s mad because you\'ll probably never see it again. Where it is, I bet only a couple of people would have seen it because it\'s a bit of a secluded spot. Now it is going to be knocked down I doubt anyone will preserve it. Once they knock it down, that\'s it. It\'s gone."</p>\n<img alt="Was Banksy in West Bromwich?" height="200" src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBVtphv.img?h=200&amp;w=300&amp;m=6&amp;q=60&amp;o=f&amp;l=f" width="300"> \xa9 Ben Smith Was Banksy in West Bromwich?\n<p>Free things to do in Sandwell with the family or for days out &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It\'s not the only alleged sighting of Banksy\'s work in the Black Country .
